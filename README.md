> I do not have a CS degree. I have a BBA. But in the last 2 years, I taught myself full-stack development and shipped 4 production applications. Not tutorials. Not todo apps. Real systems handling real users, real payments, and real data.

- Designed a dual authentication system: Better-Auth with OAuth for one user type, custom JWT with OTP for another, sharing one database
- Built a tax form engine handling 15+ conditional logic paths with multi-source data reconciliation and conflict resolution
- Implemented subscription tier enforcement with real-time usage checks across unit limits, storage quotas, and feature gating

## About Me

I completed my BBA from Barkatullah University, Bhopal in 2022. No CS background. No bootcamp. I learned full-stack development through documentation, building, breaking, and shipping.

Every project listed above was designed, built, deployed, and maintained by me independently.

I am currently looking for full-stack developer roles at startups. Remote or willing to relocate anywhere in India.
