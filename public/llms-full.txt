## Projects — Detailed

### 1. Rently
- URL: https://rently.property
- Category: Property Management / SaaS
- Tech Stack: Next.js, Nitro, tRPC, PostgreSQL (Neon), Cloudflare Workers, Better Auth
- Description: Property management app for small landlords. Landlords add properties, manage tenants, create leases, and track rent payments. Tenants get a separate portal to view lease details and submit maintenance requests.

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Edge Database Connectivity: Used Neon's HTTP driver with Drizzle ORM for stateless database queries from Cloudflare Workers edge servers (standard PostgreSQL drivers require TCP which isn't available on Workers).
- Dual Authentication System: Built two separate auth flows — Better Auth with OAuth for landlords, custom JWT with OTP and magic links for tenants — sharing the same database with isolated sessions.
- Subscription Enforcement: Built a usage checker that validates plan limits before every create action with cached subscription data to reduce database calls.

### 2. Fiscally
- URL: https://fiscally.online
- Category: Tax / Finance
- Tech Stack: Next.js, IndexedDB, Zod, jsPDF
- Description: Income tax return filing platform for India. Users prepare ITR forms (ITR-1 to ITR-7) directly in the browser. Imports data from multiple government sources, matches and reconciles conflicts, calculates tax, and generates PDF for filing. Built with a Chartered Accountant to ensure tax rule accuracy.

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Multi-Source Data Reconciliation: Built a reconciliation engine with source priority rules and tolerance-based comparisons to automatically resolve mismatches across three government data sources.
- Form 26AS Parser: Built a custom parser for the messy government text file format with inconsistent formatting, detecting section markers and handling missing data.
- Browser PDF Generation: Used jsPDF to generate professional multi-page tax documents with headers, footers, and tables entirely in the browser without a server.

### 3. CalcTrust
- URL: https://calctrust.com
- Category: Financial Calculator
- Tech Stack: Next.js, Cloudflare Workers
- Description: Financial calculator platform for U.S. salary and tax estimation. 270+ calculator pages covering salary breakdowns and paycheck estimations for all 50 U.S. states. Uses official IRS bracket data and state tax rules. 100K+ user visits. Deployed on edge servers.

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Tax Calculation Engine: Implemented using official IRS data and state-specific rules with support for graduated rate calculations across all 50 states.
- 270+ Pages Without Duplication: Built a page generator that produces all pages from centralized data definitions — change data once, all pages update.
- Zero Backend Search: Built client-side search index that matches queries like "50k in Texas" or "25 per hour yearly" using scored matching, with zero server cost.

### 4. ReelBrain
- URL: https://github.com/irishavmishra/reelbrain
- Category: AI / Video Processing
- Tech Stack: FastAPI, WhisperX, FFmpeg, Gemini, Modal
- Description: AI service that converts long videos into short vertical clips with subtitles. Upload a long video, AI identifies the best moments, detects the active speaker, crops to vertical format, adds word-level subtitles, and outputs ready-to-post short clips. Uses Google Gemini for intelligent moment selection and WhisperX for speech-to-text.

**Technical Challenges Solved:**
- Active Speaker Clipping: Used speaker detection with OpenCV and FFmpeg to identify speaking segments and dynamically crop to vertical format around the active speaker.
- AI-Powered Moment Selection: Integrated Gemini AI to analyze video content and identify the most engaging moments for short-form clips.
- Subtitle Timing: Used WhisperX for word-level timestamps and alignment so subtitles appear exactly when each word is spoken.
- GPU Processing: Deployed on Modal with GPU runtime and persistent caching for AI models for fast processing.

### 5. FancyText
- URL: https://fancytext-gen.vercel.app/
- Category: Utility Tool
- Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Description: Unicode text styling tool with 100K+ user visits. Type normal text, get dozens of styled versions using Unicode characters. Copy and paste anywhere — social media, games, bios, chats.
